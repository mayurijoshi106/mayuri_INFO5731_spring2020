Sentiment analysis also known as opinion mining is a sub field within Natural Language Processing (NLP) that builds machine learning algorithms to classify a text according to the sentimental polarities of opinions it contains, e.g., positive, negative, neutral. The purpose of this question is to develop a machine learning classifier for sentiment analysis. Based on the dataset from assignment three, write a python program to implement a sentiment classifier and evaluate its performance. Notice: **80% data for training and 20% data for testing**.  \n",
