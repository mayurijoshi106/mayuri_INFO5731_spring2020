    A XMAS gift for my sister
  
","







  
  
    So what do you give a sister who cooks, cleans, takes out the trash, and loves FaceBook?  A NEW LAPTOP!!!  I bought this laptop for the specs.  The laptop has gobbs of memory and enough hard drive space for millions of pictures.  I hope she likes it!!!  I'm pretty sure that she will love it.

    So far, after a few weeks of use, we are loving this laptop! I spent a LOT of time researching to get a laptop within our budget, that ran really well. This one checks off all the boxes! Speed, memory, sound and screen are all great! Very happy with our choice! We use this for personal and business use.

    Only thing I don’t like is even with turning on keyboard light, which has to be continually pressed, difficult to see characters on keys.

    Overall good laptop for casual  use.  I am not a fan of the backlit keyboard because it can be difficult to see the keys sometimes.  I would recommend this laptop to anyone looking for a fast, easy to use solution for shopping, reading, and reasearch.

    This laptop is used by my wife and replaces her older 2016 Dell Inspiron 15 3000 3552 laptop.  She enjoys the speed, feel of the keyboard and the touchscreen display.  Haven't heard of any complaints, only praise.

    Make sure its brand new!!

    Came in evening around 11pm so in thankful USPS was still working. But had a few scratches on the outside as if it has been used. But I'm greatly in need of a good computer and so far it's working terrific and fast. The touch screen of course doesn't really have any use unless I am feeling lazy about using the mouse but this computer is great. But please Amazon or Dell, send a brand new computer without scratches on top of it because I would have put a 5 Star if It came brand new. Buyers beware...

    I got this as a gift from my best friend.  She went all out loading it with Ram and a Sata Drive. I cannot believe how fast it is.  As soon as I hit the last digit for my password (when signing in) BOOM! It loads.  It s backlit which is a God send.  It os super slim, and lightweight.  All of my laptops have had trouble ""WAITING FOR CACHE"" in Chrome.  No more.  Nothing ever gets hung up.  I never wait for a page to load.  The touch pad was odd, so I went in and re-set the whole thing and I NEVER have a problem with it anymore.  I went in to taskmanager and turned off things running in the background, and did the same in Settings.  (Open Settings. Click on Privacy. Click on Background apps. Under the ""Choose which apps can run in the background"" section, turn off the toggle switch for the apps you want to restrict)  So these made it faster also.  I use this thing sometmes 12 hours a day and it has been a joy. I am so happy the seller made this build possible.

    Bought mine from Costco thankfully so it was super easy to return.  The fan is louder than an airplane - seriously it's so loud it's giving me a headache.  Which I might overlook if I didn't spend all my time on this computer waiting for something to happen.  Soooo sloooowwww.  I have 10-year old computers for my kids that run programs and load pages faster than this piece of junk brand new.  Pretty much giving up on Dell at this point.
